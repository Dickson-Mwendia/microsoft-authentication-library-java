# Microsoft Authentication Library for Java

The Microsoft Authentication Library for Java (usually shortened to MSAL Java or MSAL4J) enables applications to integrate with the [Microsoft identity platform](https://aka.ms/aaddevv2). It allows you to sign in users or apps with Microsoft identities (Azure AD, Microsoft accounts and Azure AD B2C accounts) and obtain tokens to call Microsoft APIs such as [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io/) or your own APIs registered with the Microsoft identity platform. It is built using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols.

## Overview

1. [Why use MSAL4J?](Why-use-MSAL4J)

2. **Pre-requisite**: Before using MSAL4J you will have to [register your applications with Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications).

3. Learn about the supported [scenarios](Scenarios).

4. To start using MSAL4J, instantiate and configure the [client application](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/wiki/Client-Applications).

5. Learn about the ways to [acquire a token](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/wiki/Acquiring-Tokens) using MSAL4J. This returns an [IAuthenticationResult](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/wiki/IAuthenticationResult).

6. Follow [best practices for a robust enterprise ready application](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/wiki/Best-Practices-for-a-robust-enterprise-ready-application).

7. Refer [FAQ](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/wiki/FAQs) for common issues and known bugs.
