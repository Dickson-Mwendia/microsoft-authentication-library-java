# Microsoft Authentication Library for Java

The Microsoft Authentication Library for Java (usually shortened to MSAL Java or MSAL4J) enables applications to integrate with the [Microsoft identity platform](https://aka.ms/aaddevv2). It allows you to sign in users or apps with Microsoft identities (Azure AD, Microsoft accounts and Azure AD B2C accounts) and obtain tokens to call Microsoft APIs such as [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io/) or your own APIs registered with the Microsoft identity platform. It is built using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols.

## Overview

1. [Why use MSAL4J?](getting-started/why-use-msal4j.md)

2. **Pre-requisite**: Before using MSAL4J you will have to [register your applications with Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications).

3. Learn about the supported [scenarios](getting-started/scenarios.md).

4. To start using MSAL4J, instantiate and configure the [client application](getting-started/client-applications.md).

5. Learn about the ways to [acquire a token](getting-started/acquiring-tokens.md) using MSAL4J. This returns an [IAuthenticationResult](getting-started/iauthenticationresult.md).

6. Follow [best practices for a robust enterprise ready application](advanced/best-practices-enterprise.md).

7. Refer [FAQ](getting-started/faq.md) for common issues and known bugs.

## Releases
